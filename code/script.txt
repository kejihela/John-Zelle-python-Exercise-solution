How you doing Notice the use of slicing to strip off the newline character at the end of the line. Since print automatically jumps to the next line (i.e., it outputs a newline),printing with the explicit newline at the end would put an extra blank line of output between the lines of the file. Alternatively, you could print the whole line, but simply tell print not to add its own newline character.
