I'm an M.sc student in computer science currently working on a computer vision project in area of fishries. 
it is well known today that most fish farmings businesses are greatly affected by some underlying diseases 
which can cause great disasters to the farming business. in fisheries " An injury to one is an injury to all". 
if this underlying diseases are not detected on time so as to take the proper precautionary measures it can result to massive 
lost to ones farm. thus, the introduction of deep neural network in fish farming can leads to a significant increase in 
fish farming production where diseases can be uncovered in no time and proper cautions are taken in other to curb any damages
that could be incured from the disease. if I'm able to get this funding i will direct it towards the application of 
of technology towards my fish farming business to increase productivity and security of work.
