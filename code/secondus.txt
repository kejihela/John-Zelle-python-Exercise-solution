Effective leadership is one of the key factors for a country to sustain her economy in the advent of problems caused by socio-economic vices (Yazdanifard, 2015 ). Leaders are the one who control and take charge of the operation of a country by setting optimistic goals and objective while steering the operation of the country towards those goals through effective strategies (Syeda Ruksana, 2017). More so, leadership is essential in managing change and change is the only method to sustain a country. As usual change is hard for people, people will feel uncomfortable because of change and sometimes they deny the change. Therefore, leadership is also one of the factors to motivate and encourage people to continuously make change and push them to change.  Undoubtedly, the administrability, transparency, reliability, and validity of the means at which these leaders are selected in a country should not be questioned. Hence, the research requirement of numerous and sophisticated technological innovation to support the electoral process cannot be over-emphasized. Therefore, the introduction of facial recognition for authentication in electoral process is a need in the free and fair electoral process.
