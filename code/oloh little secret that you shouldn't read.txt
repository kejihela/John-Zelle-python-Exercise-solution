my name is Abue Oloh Divine i am my age year old well i think i'm tall but people call me short i've always told myself that i'm a tall girl i am taller than uncle keji but i look shorter anyways i don't like noise or anything that wll be of threat to my mental health when i'm mad at someone or pissed at someone and i try to ignore the person so that i won't disrespect the person i just cry. Sometimes i can be rude to people when they have pissed me off or when they have also been rude to me so i just want it to be equal because life is all about equality thats all about me.
